    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Stone Sparks. I am a recent graduate from the University of Southern Mississippi, where I obtained my bachelor's in computer science. I am passionate about learning and technology. Currently,
       I am an aspiring software developer. During my time at Southern Miss, I gained a foundation in computer science, learning C++ along with many other languages. I consider myself to be a passionate team member who truly cares about productive collaboration and quality output, and I am searching for a role where I can apply these principles.
